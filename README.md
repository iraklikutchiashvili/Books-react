# Reading List

## About

It's an application where you can add books in your reading list and remove them after completion.


## My Process


In process of building used following React topics: JavaScript/ES6 functional components, context API and hooks.
* useState - to add states to functional components and use it for local components. In this example used to add and update user inputs(title,author)
* useReducer - to manage multiple state transitions and use it in the case of global state to avoid complexity.
* useEffect - to perform side effects in components. In this example used to populate local storage in browser, when specific state changes.
* Context API - to share state between several parent and child components with the help of a provider.
* useContext - to access shared state in child components.
